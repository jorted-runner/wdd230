            <p>I believe that Home Depot does a good job of using the rule of thirds.
                On their site the users attention is drawn to four main points.
                First the discount, second a product, third a product and finally a
                link to shop the products.

            <img src="images/tracksmith.png" alt="Screen Shot of Tracksmith Site">
            <p>Tracksmith is a good example of alignment because they draw all of the users attention
                to the center of the page. The center of the page is where they are introducing their 
                new theme. All the text here in the center of the page is center aligned and in the 
                center of the screen.

            <img src="images/nike.png" alt="Screen Shot of Nike Site">
            <p>Nike is a pretty good example of Hick's Law. Each area has a minimal amount of
                choices it is presenting to the user. The header has 4 initial choices. Search,
                 Cart, Account, Menu. From there the user can expand to get more choices but
                 initially it is a paired down menu that allows the user to quickly decide what
                 they want to do.
